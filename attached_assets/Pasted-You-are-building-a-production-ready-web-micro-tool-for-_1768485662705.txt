You are building a production-ready web micro-tool for Recruiterflow called
“Agency Velocity Audit”.

Branding & Visual Direction:
- Match Recruiterflow’s existing product UI (clean, calm, premium)
- Primary color: Recruiterflow blue
- White backgrounds, subtle light-grey borders
- Rounded containers, minimal shadows
- Avoid gradients, avoid heavy animations, avoid marketing-style visuals
- Typography should feel like a product, not a landing page

UI Flow:
1. Welcome Screen
   - Header: “Agency Velocity Audit”
   - Subtext: “Take this 30-second audit to benchmark your tracking vs top agencies.”
   - Primary CTA: “Start Audit”
   - Show a custom SVG rocket icon above the title
   - Add a very subtle animation to the rocket (slow vertical float or gentle exhaust pulse)
   - Animation must stop once the user clicks “Start Audit”

2. Questions (4 total)
   - Card-based answers (4 per question)
   - Each card includes: icon (SVG), title, short helper text
   - Auto-advance on selection
   - Show progress indicator (1/4, 2/4, etc.)
   - Allow back navigation with state preserved
   - No animations on answer cards

3. Result Screen (IMPORTANT COPY CHANGE)
   - Do NOT say “See how Recruiterflow solves this”
   - Position the CTA as a conversation / validation step, not a demo

   Use this structure:
   - Header: “What this means for your agency”
   - Body copy explaining the category in a calm, diagnostic tone
   - Explain what agencies at this stage typically struggle with
   - Set expectations for a short, tailored conversation

   CTA Button:
   - Label: “Talk to a Recruiterflow specialist”
   - Subtext: “15–20 minutes · No prep needed”
   - CTA opens a configurable Calendly link

Scoring Logic:
- Config-driven scoring via quiz.json
- Each answer contributes to a score
- Score maps to one of 4 categories:
  - Reactive
  - Manual
  - Managed
  - High-velocity
- Result copy must be editable via config, not hardcoded

Personalization:
- Read URL parameters:
  - company, persona, industry, utm_source, utm_campaign
- If company exists, subtly personalize the welcome headline
- Sanitize all inputs

Webflow Compatibility (Critical):
- App must support script-based embedding into a div:
  <div id="rf-agency-audit"></div>
- Also support iframe embedding as fallback
- Must be fully responsive and not overflow Webflow containers
- Avoid global CSS pollution

Tech Stack:
- React + Vite + TypeScript
- Tailwind or scoped CSS
- Single JSON config file for questions, scoring, results, and CTA links

Analytics (MVP):
- Emit events via a simple emit() function:
  - audit_viewed
  - audit_started
  - question_answered
  - audit_completed
  - cta_clicked
- Log to console for now, structured for GA4 later

Deliverables:
- Working UI matching the provided mockups
- quiz.json example populated
- README with:
  - local setup
  - build steps
  - Webflow embed instructions
  - how to edit questions and result copy
