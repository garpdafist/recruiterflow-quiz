Build a production-ready micro web tool called “Recruiterflow Agency Velocity Audit” that runs as a standalone web app AND can be embedded seamlessly into Webflow.

Core UX:

Screen 0 (Welcome): logo + “Agency Velocity Audit” + 1–2 line description + primary CTA “Start Audit”

Screen 1–4: 4 questions total, each with a title, subtitle, and 4 answer cards (icon, label, subtext)

Show progress indicator “1/4”, “2/4”, etc. in the top-right

On selecting an answer, auto-advance to the next question

Allow back navigation via a back arrow in the top-left (preserve prior answers)

Final screen (Results):

Show a category title (ex: “Category: The ‘Reactive’ Agency”)

Show a short explanation paragraph (2–4 lines)

Show a single primary CTA button that opens Calendly (“Talk to our team” / “Book a demo”)

The CTA label + Calendly link must be configurable

Scoring / Logic:

Use a config-driven scoring model:

Each answer option maps to a score or tag.

Total score maps to 1 of 4 categories (ex: “Reactive”, “Manual”, “Managed”, “High-velocity”).

Store: selected answers, total score, category, and query-string personalization params.

Personalization:

Read URL params such as:

company, persona, industry, source, utm_source, utm_campaign

If company exists, update welcome headline subtly (ex: “Agency Velocity Audit for {company}”).

Always sanitize user inputs.

Webflow embedding requirement:

Must support BOTH:

Script-embed mount into a div (preferred): <div id="rf-agency-audit"></div>

iFrame embed (fallback)

Provide a lightweight embed snippet and ensure responsive sizing.

Avoid requiring server-side rendering.

Analytics:

Emit GA4-friendly events (just console.log event payloads in dev mode; provide a hook to connect GA4 later):

audit_viewed, audit_started, question_answered (question_id, answer_id), audit_completed (category), cta_clicked

Engineering:

Build with React + Vite + TypeScript.

Use a single JSON config file for questions, answers, scoring, result copy, and calendly link routing.

Keep styling clean, similar to the provided mockups: large rounded container, subtle border/shadow, big buttons, modern typography.

Output should include:

/src with components

/public embed file if needed

README with: how to run, how to build, how to host, how to embed in Webflow, and how to edit quiz.json

Deliver a working UI with sample questions matching the mockups:
Q1: “How fast do you spot missed targets?”
Q2: “What drives your forecasting?”
Q3/Q4: Create similar operational questions aligned to agency recruiting workflow tracking.
Results: include at least 4 categories with short copy and CTA.
