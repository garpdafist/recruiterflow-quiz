# PRD — Recruiterflow Agency Velocity Audit (Web + Webflow Embed)

## 1. Purpose
Create a lightweight “audit-style” interactive quiz that identifies where a recruiting agency is in its operational maturity/visibility journey and routes them to a Calendly booking CTA.

This is designed for:
- 1:1 ABM campaigns (primary)
- broader paid/organic campaigns (secondary)

## 2. Goals
### Primary
- Increase Calendly bookings (demo / talk-to-team)
- Increase ABM conversion by making the experience feel personalized and diagnostic
- Capture “journey stage” + operational pain areas for sales context

### Secondary
- Reusable landing module inside Webflow pages without engineering overhead
- Provide analytics on completion + category distribution

## 3. Target Audience
- Recruitment/staffing agencies (owners, ops leaders, lead recruiters)
- Teams evaluating ATS/CRM tools or trying to improve pipeline visibility, forecasting, and execution

## 4. User Flow
1) Welcome Screen
- Title: “Agency Velocity Audit”
- Subtext: “Take this 30-second audit to benchmark tracking vs. top agencies.”
- CTA: “Start Audit”

2) Questions (4 total)
- Card-based options (4 per question)
- Auto-advance on selection
- Progress indicator (e.g., 1/4)
- Back arrow to revise previous answers

3) Results Screen
- Category label (e.g., “The ‘Reactive’ Agency”)
- 2–4 line explanation
- Primary CTA button: “Talk to our team” or “Book a demo”
- Opens Calendly

## 5. Quiz Content Requirements
- 4 questions in MVP (can be expanded later)
- Answer options must be:
  - short labels (1–2 words)
  - supportive subtext (1 line)
  - icon placeholder support

## 6. Scoring & Categorization
- Config-driven scoring:
  - Each answer contributes a score or tag
- Total score maps to one of 4 categories:
  - Reactive (low visibility)
  - Manual (inconsistent visibility)
  - Managed (repeatable process)
  - High-velocity (high visibility + proactive)

## 7. Personalization (ABM)
Support URL params:
- company, persona, industry, source, utm_source, utm_campaign
Rules:
- If company present, personalize welcome header subtly
- Always provide a clean fallback if params missing
- Sanitize all param values

## 8. CTA & Calendly
- CTA label + Calendly link must be configurable
- Optional future: route Calendly link by category/persona (ABM optimization)

## 9. Analytics Events (MVP)
Emit events (GA4-friendly naming):
- audit_viewed
- audit_started
- question_answered (question_id, answer_id)
- audit_completed (category, score)
- cta_clicked (calendly_url)

## 10. Non-Functional Requirements
- Mobile responsive
- Fast load (optimize bundle)
- Accessible interactions (keyboard focus, ARIA labels)
- Works embedded in Webflow without breaking layout

## 11. Out of Scope (MVP)
- Admin panel to edit questions
- Auth/login
- CRM writebacks (HubSpot/Salesforce)
- Multi-language
- Deep branching logic

# TRD — Recruiterflow Agency Velocity Audit (Replit Build + Webflow Embed)

## 1. Architecture
### Recommended
A standalone static web app (React + Vite + TypeScript) that can be:
- hosted as its own URL (subdomain or path)
- embedded into Webflow via:
  A) script mount (preferred)
  B) iframe embed (fallback)

## 2. Webflow Seamless Embedding
### Option A: Script Mount (Preferred)
- Webflow adds:
  - <div id="rf-agency-audit"></div>
- Webflow includes generated JS bundle via script tag
- App mounts into the div and inherits page context

Pros:
- cleaner analytics + UTM capture
- better brand consistency

### Option B: iFrame (Fallback)
- Webflow embeds:
  - <iframe src="https://.../agency-audit?utm_..." />
Pros:
- fastest to deploy
Cons:
- analytics needs postMessage if you want parent-page GA4

## 3. Frontend Stack
- React + Vite + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind or CSS modules
- Config file: quiz.json

## 4. Data Model
### quiz.json should include:
- metadata: title, subtitle
- questions: [{ id, title, subtitle, options: [{ id, label, subtext, icon, score }] }]
- results: [{ category_id, min_score, max_score, title, badge_text, description }]
- cta: { default_label, default_calendly_url, routing_rules(optional) }

## 5. State Management
In-memory state (MVP):
- currentStep
- answers map { questionId: optionId }
- totalScore
- computedCategory
Optional:
- localStorage (to prevent accidental loss on refresh)

## 6. Personalization
- Read URLSearchParams at app load
- Supported: company, persona, industry, source, utm_source, utm_campaign
- Sanitize inputs (no HTML injection)
- Expose personalization object to components

## 7. Analytics
- Provide a single event emitter function:
  emit(eventName, payload)
MVP:
- console.log payloads
Production:
- can be wired to GA4 / Segment

## 8. Calendly Handling
- CTA opens calendly link in same tab or new tab (configurable)
- Append useful params:
  - category, score, company, persona, utm_campaign (as query params where possible)

## 9. Hosting & Handoff
Replit is for development only.
Handoff package to Recruiterflow dev:
- /dist build output
- quiz.json
- README:
  - local dev
  - build steps
  - embed snippets (script + iframe)
  - how to edit quiz.json
  - event names + payload schema

## 10. QA Checklist
- All steps render on mobile and desktop
- Progress indicator correct
- Back navigation restores previous selections
- Category mapping correct at score boundaries
- CTA works + preserves UTMs
- Webflow embed works without layout overflow
